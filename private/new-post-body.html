<p>As I type this, I have been working as a software developer for just about seven years now.  I have worked on many successful projects utilizing a variety of technologies.  As far as I know my clients have always been satisfied with the solutions I have delivered.  Despite my successful career, I have always had it in the back of my mind that I have neglected to do something important...</p>
<p>I've never built a website!</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying that I have never <strong>worked on</strong> a website before.  I do that almost every day.  What I mean is that I have never sat down with empty folder and created that very first index.html file.  Some part of me has always felt that I <i>had</i> to create something from scratch in this manner.  It hasn't come up in the course of my work, and I don't expect it to, not when sites like Wix and WordPress make it a simple point-and-click affair to get a site up and running.</p>
<p>So, when I found myself interested in writing a blog, the idea of creating it from scratch bubbled to the surface.  It didn't take hold immediately however...</p>
<p>I took a look at WordPress first, created a site on the free tier (I am what you might call <q>frugal</q>, or maybe a cheap SOB.  Take your pick.) and I wasn't all that impressed.  It felt so limiting.  If you can imagine, it was like taking away my motorcycle and replacing it with my toddlers bike, training wheels and all.  I didn't want that, I wanted as much control as possible, <i>without</i> paying for it of course.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be perfectly clear.  <strong>I am NOT an expert on WordPress.</strong>  I'm barely even acquainted.  You might be saying that I didn't even give WordPress a real chance, and that I couldn't possibly know if it was actually limiting or not, and you'd be right.  I didnt give WordPress a real chance. I  knew as soon as I started looking into it that I simply didn't feel like learning how to do it their way.  What WordPress would have likely saved me is time.  It would have however, robbed me of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Another revelation that might sound strange to you... this is the first development project that I have ever taken it upon myself to build.  In the past I have found my creative outlets in places far from the skillset of my day job.  Working on and riding my motorcycle, renovating my house, restoring old tools, woodworking, all a far cry from what pays the bills.  The idea of building this website/blog is the first thing that drew me to the computer after hours with a desire to create, and it has been some of the most enjoyable work of this type that I have done.</p>
<p>So, this is the origin story of this site.  As I write this, my first post, the site isn't even close to what I would consider complete.  The layout is constantly evolving, the color scheme is highly questionable, and most of the links do nothing because I've spent so much time architecting and re-architecting the structure and function of the site that it's all I can do to refine the three pages that currently exist.  If you've made it this far, I'd really like to <strong>thank you for reading!</strong>  I don't know when I'll find the time to write another post between improving the site itself and the rest of my life, but I hope by then it looks better than this...</p>
